# Abstract
Seven people die from stress every two seconds. What do anxiety, panic attacks, depression, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, fears, phobias, irritable bowel, fibromyalgia, ulcers, self-destructive habits like overeating, and others all have in common?

They are all either caused by or made worse by STRESS! Our idea is to reduce stress level. What is the best way to do this if not with a spa?

According to Bruce Becker, MD, immersing yourself in water in general up to your neck gives you a cardiac workout; Mayo Clinic researcher Thomas Allison PhD, did a study that shows that sitting in a spa bath can lower your blood pressure.

Many people in the spas and wellness centers do wrong journey and are afraid to use some room.

SUOMI lets a spa owner to turn a spa into a smart one for better results, thanks to microcontrollers connected to a software that will help spa users to make for them decisions about wellness journey.

So, SUOMI turns an old spa into a smart one. How? SUOMI will be a “smart guide” that will help a spa customer to maximize its benefit and to avoid dangerous practices.
